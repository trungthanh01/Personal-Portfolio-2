                <p class="hero__description">I have been a Bell Attendant at Renaissance Hotel since May 8, 2023.
                    Recently, I found my hobby besides my bookshelf, which is Coding.
                    
                    In addition to my main job, I spend 3+ hours every night learning more about Web Development. I started learning from June 6, 2025 until now. <br> 
                    I have only worked on small projects that I cherish such as: Web App to manage personal finances, personal Website, and recently I am working on a Website for a local English center. <br>
                    <br>
                    My goal in Coding is to understand what a programming language is and be able to create a product like an App, Web App or a modern and beautiful Website myself. <br>
                    
                    Of course, I will not write it myself, but I will use AI Agent to write it for me. If you ask me why I use AI Agent or Vibe Coding, the answer is "Why not?". <br>
                    But sometimes I wonder if companies want to hire a Dev who only knows Vibe Coding? I think probably not, because if so, everyone can do it, so I have no intention of applying to any company. Build some products yourself to earn extra income, Freelance or Colab with a team,... <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, I am also a fan of Crypto, I invested in Chainlink since March 2023 and recently World Coin. I set up an effective way to use money by dividing money into 5 jars, each month I will invest a little bit in the future and sit and wait for the dream of becoming a millionaire to come haha, just kidding, whatever. <br>
                    <br>
                    Sometimes I also write, actually it's been a long time since I wrote because I was stuck with time to study every night. I usually write about self-development, personal finance management, crypto, startups and sometimes nonsense articles.

                            <a href="https://montracker.netlify.app/" class="projects__link" target="_blank">MonTracker</a>
                            <p class="project-description">MonTracker is a web application that allows you to track your monthly expenses and income.
                                I use the method of dividing money into different jars and it seems to be effective. <br>
                                We will know what to use this money for and how to save it effectively. For the above reason, I wrote this web app to solve my own problem, instead of just dividing money into jars on the shelf, I now put it on the web app. <br>
                                Currently it is only in Vietnamese but I will update English soon.

                            <p class="project-description">Sally English is a website for a local English center.
                                This is the English center that I mentioned above, this is a small center project and the client asked me to make a website that represents her center as a virtual home on the Internet. <br>
                                A website does not require too much sophistication in terms of UI, so it just needs to be enough for her customers to easily read the content and understand the entire English center on one page.
